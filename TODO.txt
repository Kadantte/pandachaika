TODO: Store the queue temporally on the database to prevent queue loss on restarts.
TODO: Matchers should check if the gallery encountered at first is present locally first, and get their metadata from there, and only after that, get their metadata remotely.
TODO: Matchers right now call each provider directly, they don't go through the queue, which is not the ideal method, since we could possibly go over the limit for each provider.
TODO: Matchers should queue the URL (as _info), then fetch the metadata from the database.
TODO: Separate queues for each provider.
TODO: Change remotesite format, send metadata directly, don't send links to crawl and allow other providers. Do this by exposing InternalParser.
TODO: Each provider should have it's own schedule in auto_wanted.
TODO: Improve the preload login, prioritize next images over last ones, single queue over parallel.
TODO: COL: Enable web matcher.
